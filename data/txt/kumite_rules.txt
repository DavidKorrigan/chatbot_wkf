WORLD KARATE FEDERATION
KUMITE COMPETITION RULES
Valid from 1.1.2026.

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Kumite Rules is to provide standardized rules for all levels of Championships promoted or recognized by the World Karate Federation (WKF), WKF Continental Federations, and WKF Member National Federations. The Competition Rules are intended to ensure that all matters related to competitions are conducted in a safe, fair, and orderly manner.
 
ARTICLE 1: KUMITE COMPETITION AREA
1.1 The competition area will be a WKF Approved matted square, with sides of eight metres (measured from the outside) with the mats in the outer one-metre area in another colour, marking the boundary.  There will be a 2 metres safety area surrounding the competition area.

1.2 There will be a minimum of 2 metres between competition areas.

1.3 There must be no advertisements, signs, walls, pillars, etc. within one metre of the safety area's outer perimeter.

1.4 Where monitors or displays are placed between the competition areas, these must be placed far enough from the competition areas to allow a safety area of 2 metres between competition areas on all sides. (The monitors must be placed at a minimum of 2 metres from the outside of the outer different coloured warning area.)

1.5 Two mats are inverted with the red (or otherwise coloured) side turned up in one metre distance from the mat centre to form a boundary between the Athletes. When starting or resuming combat, the Athletes will be standing front and centre on the mat facing each other.

1.6 The Referee (SHUSHIN) will be standing centred between the two mats, facing the Athletes at a distance of two metres from the boundary of the competition area. Each Judge (FUKUSHIN) will be seated at the designated area. If seated on the TATAMI, they will be placed approximately 1.5 metres off the corners in the safety area.

1.7 The Referee may move around the entire Tatami, including the safety area where the Judges are seated. Each Judge will be equipped with a red and a blue flag or an electronic signal device.

1.8 The Match Supervisor (KANSA) will be seated at the official table. They will be equipped with a whistle.

1.9 The Score Supervisor will be seated at the official score table beside the score/timekeeper, and where video is deployed, so will the Video Review Judge.

1.10 Coaches will be seated outside the safety area, on their respective sides of the TATAMI towards the official table. In cases where the configuration of Tatami makes it impractical to place the Coaches facing the official table, they may instead be placed on each side of the official table. If in such cases, video review is used, Coach supervisors must be deployed.

3.2 Weigh-in procedure
 
3.2.1 Rehearsal weighing
Athletes shall be allowed to check their weight on the official weigh-in scales (that will be used for the official weigh-in) from one hour before the official weigh-in commences. There is no limit to the number of times each Athlete may check their weight during the time of the unofficial weigh-in.

3.2.2 Official weighing:
a) Place:
The weight control will always take place in only one location. The possibilities to host this control are the competition venue, the official hotel or the village (To be announced for each event). Organizers must provide separate rooms for men and women.

b) Scales:
If the official scale shows a higher weight than the scale provided for test weighing, the Athlete can demand to be weighed again, applying the weight shown on the test scale as the official result of the weigh-in.
The host NF should provide enough calibrated electronic scales (at least 4 units) showing only one decimal place, e.g. 51.9 kg, 104.6 kg. The scale should be placed on a solid floor that is not carpeted.
 
c) Time:
Weigh-in must take place no later than the day before the competition for the category, unless specified otherwise for a specific competition. The official weigh-in time for WKF events will be duly announced on the bulletin. For any other events, this information will be distributed in advance through the OC communication channels. It is the responsibility of the Athlete to be aware of this information. An Athlete who does not turn up for the weigh-in period or fails to weigh within the prescribed limits for the category in which the Athlete is registered will be disqualified (KIKEN).
 
d) Tolerance:
The tolerances admitted are 0.2 kg for all male categories and 0.5 kg for all female categories.
The same tolerance applies to both the upper and lower limits of a weight class.
 
e) Procedure: 
A minimum of two WKF officials are required at the weigh-in for each gender. One to check the accreditation/passport of the Athlete, and one to record the exact weight on the official weigh-in list. An additional six staff members (officials/volunteers) supplied by the host NF should also be available to control the flow of Athletes. Twelve chairs must be supplied. To protect the privacy of the Athletes, officials, as well as the staff members supervising the weigh-in, must be of the same gender as the Athletes.
1. The official weigh-in will be done category by category and Athlete by Athlete.
2. All Coaches and other Team delegates must leave the weigh-in room before the start of the official weigh-in.
3. The Athlete is allowed to stand on the scales only once during the official weigh-in period.
4. Each Athlete shall bring to the weigh-in their accreditation card issued for the event and shall present it to the official, who will verify the identity of the Athlete.
5. The official then invites the Athlete to stand on the scales.
6. The Athlete shall weigh-in wearing only underclothing (men/boys – underpants, women/girls – underpants and bra). Any socks or additional complements must be removed.
7. The official supervising the weigh-in shall note and record the Athlete’s weight in kilograms (accurate to one decimal point of a kilogram).
8. The Athlete steps off the scales. 
 
NOTE: Photography or filming is not permitted in the weigh-in area. This includes the use of mobile phones and all other devices.
 
3.3 Seeding

3.4 Competition formats
3.4.1 Karate Kumite competition takes the form of individual competition divided by gender, age groups, and weight categories or Team competition by gender without weight categories or mixed teams, either with or without weight categories, and can be organised in several formats:
a) Elimination system with repechage for Individuals or Teams. (Used unless otherwise specified for the competition).
b) Round-robin in groups followed by Elimination for individuals or Teams. (Used for individual Premier League competitions and the Senior World Championships for both individuals and Teams).
c) Two-pool Round-robin system (used for multisport games).
 
3.4.2 The Elimination system with repechage will be applied unless otherwise pre-determined for a specific competition or series of tournaments.
 
3.4.3 For individual competition in Premier League, the Senior Individual World Championships and the World Team Championships, the Round-robin system followed by Elimination is applied.
 
3.4.4 For multisport games, such as continental games, Olympic Games, or other multisport events, the format of competition will be determined for each event depending on modalities included and restrictions on participation. The format used is normally a two-pool system where the winners of the pools go to the final.
 
3.5 Composition of Kumite Teams
3.5.1 Matches in Kumite for male Teams consist of 5 bouts. The Team must present 5 participants for the initial match.  To participate in Round-robin competition, the Team must also have 2 additional back-up Athletes registered for possible participation in subsequent bouts and may also have a third optional back-up Athlete - bringing the maximum size of the Team to 8 Athletes. For any elimination matches, the Team must always have a minimum of 3 participants in order to compete.

3.5.2 Matches in Kumite for female Teams consist of 3 bouts. The Team must present 3 participants for the initial match. To participate in Round-robin competition, the Team must also have 1 additional back-up Athlete registered for possible participation in subsequent bouts and may also have a second optional back-up Athlete - bringing the maximum size of the Team to 5 Athletes. For any elimination match, the Team must always have a minimum of 2 participants in order to compete.

3.5.3 In Team Kumite competition without weight categories, the Team change which of the Team members should participate in each match. For a tie-break bout, the Team may submit a single name as they would normally do for a new round.

3.5.4 During Round-robin competition, the Team must complete all bouts in order to remain in the competition. If it does not, all bouts and matches will be voided, and no victory points or scoring points will be counted. Likewise, all victory points and scoring points earned by other Teams in meeting the Team eliminated will be voided.

3.5.5 In the second match of an Elimination tournament, and in the Elimination phase following Round-robin, male Teams can never present fewer than 3 Athletes for a match and female Teams can never present fewer than 2.

3.5.6 Matches in Mixed Team Competition consist of 4 or 6 bouts, with an equal number of Athletes of each gender. The Team must present a full team for the initial round. For any subsequent rounds the team must present a number of Athletes sufficient to win by the number of bouts won.

3.5.7 In Mixed Team Competition by weight categories each team must present all Athletes in all designated weight categories, both male and female.
 
3.5.8 The designated weight categories for Mixed Team Competition are those used for multiple sport games, 3 male and 3 female to a total of 6 weight categories.
 
3.6 Fighting order for Teams
3.6.1 Before each match, a Team representative must hand to the official table an official form defining the names and fighting order of the competing Team members.

3.6.2 The fighting order form can be presented by the Coach or a nominated Athlete from the Team. If the Coach hands in the form, they must be clearly identifiable as such; otherwise, it can be rejected. The list must include the name of the country, the belt colour allocated to the Team for that match and the fighting order of the Team members. Both the Athletes’ names and their tournament numbers must be included, and the form must be signed by the Coach or a nominated person. 

3.6.3 Coaches must present their accreditation together with that of their Athlete or Team to the Coach Supervisor or Kansa Assistant. For Team competition, it is allowed to use two Coaches, but only one Coach can actively be coaching in each bout, while the other must sit in the chair provided without interfering with the progress of the bout.

3.6.5 The participants can be selected for each round from the full Team. Their fighting order can be changed for each round, provided the new fighting order is notified before the round, but once notified, it cannot be changed until that round is completed.

3.6.6 The Team will be disqualified (SHIKKAKU) if any of its members or its Coach changes the Team's composition or fighting order without written notification prior to the round.

3.6.7 If, through an error in charting, the wrong Athlete/Team competes, then regardless of the outcome, that bout/match is declared null and void. To reduce such errors, the Score Supervisor must confirm the winning Athlete/Team with the software technician immediately after the bout/match.

3.6.8 In Team matches where an individual loses on account of receiving KIKEN, HANSOKU or SHIKKAKU, any score for the disqualified Athlete will be set to zero, and a score of 8-0 (counted as YUKO) will be recorded for that bout in favour of the other Team.

3.7 Round-robin, Individual Competition
3.7.1 
In individual Premier League events, Round-robin competition using groups of 4 Athletes, the maximum 32 participants are divided into 8 groups of 4 Athletes or fewer. The winner of each of the eight groups go on to regular quarterfinals, semi-finals and final. The losers to the finalists in the quarter- and semi-finals compete for the bronze medals. While in Individual World Senior Championship Phase 2, the winners and runners-up of each of the 8 groups advance to the regular round 16, quarterfinals, semi-finals and final. The losers to the finalists in the quarter- and semi-finals compete for the bronze medals.

3.7.2 According to the number of Athletes (32 or less), the allocation to groups will be as per the following table: Section manquante
 
3.7.3 If an individual is disqualified or is unable to complete all bouts in the Round-robin, the scores of completed or current bouts will be nullified, and their victory points forfeited, unless it is the last bout of the Round-robin, in which case, all previous results and points remain unchanged.

3.7.4 The winner and runner-up of each group are determined by whoever has the most victory points by counting wins as three points per win, one point for a draw where points are scored. Bouts lost or draws with no scores give zero points.

3.7.5 The winners of the semi-finals will then go on to the final, where they compete for gold and silver.

3.7.6 Those who have lost to the finalists in the quarter finals and semi-finals will compete for the bronze medals (One for groups 1-4 and one for groups 5-8).

3.8 Phase 1 of the Individual World Championships
For Phase 1 of the Individual World Championships, there is no limitation to 32 Athletes per category, and when required, the number of groups will be increased as well as the number of Athletes within the same group. Additional rounds of Round-robin will be fought until the number of winners qualified to proceed is 24 or less, after which straight Elimination bouts will determine the 6 winners that will qualify for Phase 2.

3.9 World Cup for National Teams
For the World Cup, the Round-robin system followed by quarterfinals, semi-finals and final is applied. 5 Teams are allocated to each group. The winners and the runners-up of each group then compete in quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. After the Group Phase, the Group Winners and runners-up advance to the quarter-finals, where the bout winners head to the Semi-Finals and the winner to the Finals. Those who have lost to the finalists in the semi-finals will compete for one bronze medal. The winner of the finals receives the gold medal while the loser receives a silver medal. The winner of the bronze match will take bronze, while the losing Team is not awarded a medal.
  
3.10 Variations to competition formats
If a variation of the competition format other than described in these rules is to be applied for a particular tournament, this must be clearly announced in the tournament bulletin.

3.11 Coaching
3.11.1 In World Championships, Kumite Coaches need to be part of a National Federation delegation and have the required Coach certification level when acting during the bout of an Athlete.

3.11.2 Exceptionally, in competitions with Video Review and upon prior request of the NF, WKF may authorize a Coach from a different delegation to act as a Coach for their delegation in the situations herein, provided that they comply with the dress code as established in art. 2.3.1, in order to cover the special circumstances arising from the need to have a Coach to request Video Review: 
- A NF having registered one or more Coaches in Kumite categories, but the Coach(es) cannot attend the event due to visa problems, transport incidents, sudden health issues or any other justified cause,
- A NF that, for budgetary reasons or being part of the WKF development programme, does not have funds to include Kumite Coach(es) within their delegation,
- A Refugee athlete, or
- A Coach being disqualified from competition, and as a result, the Athletes of their NF do not have any Kumite Coach.

3.11.3 If a NF is in any of the above-mentioned situations, and only during a World Championships, the OC Chair may authorize (subject to the President’s ratification) to make an exception.

3.11.4 In official WKF events, with the exception of Youth League, it is not permitted to change the Coach during a bout. In team matches, it is allowed to change the Coach between bouts.

It remains the duty of any official to self-report on any possible conflict of interest before the bout or match starts.

4.2 Referees and Judges’ deployment and panel allocation

4.2.1 For the eliminatory rounds, the RC Secretary will deliver to the software system technician handling the electronic drawing system a list containing the Referees and Judges available per TATAMI. This list is done by the RC Secretary once the Athletes’ draw is finished and at the end of the Referees’ Briefing. This list must only contain Referees present at the Briefing and must comply with the above-mentioned criteria. Then, for the Referees draw, the software technician will enter the list in the system, and 4 Judges, 1 Referee, 1 Match Supervisor (KANSA), and 1 Score Supervisor out of each TATAMI deployment will be randomly allocated as Referee Panel for each bout.

4.2.2 Where video review is used, a Video Review Judge is allocated in the same manner.

4.2.3 For medal bouts, the Tatami Managers will provide the RC Chairman and Secretary with a list containing 8 officials from their own TATAMI after the last bout of the eliminatory rounds is finished. Once the list is approved by the RC Chairman, it will be given to the software technician to be entered into the system. The system will then randomly allocate the Referee panel, which will only contain 5 out of the 8 officials from each TATAMI.
 
4.3 Supporting officials
4.3.1 In addition, for facilitating the operation of bouts/matches, 1 Tatami Manager, 3 Tatami Manager Assistants, and 1 Score/Timekeeper shall be appointed plus 2 Kansa Assistants for checking the Athlete’s equipment and 2 Coach Supervisors in instances where the configuration of TATAMI makes it necessary to see the Coaches requests for video review, or for any other reason deemed necessary by the Chief Referee.

4.3.2 Before the start of each match or bout, Kansa Assistants will ensure that Athletes’ equipment and Karategi are in accordance with the WKF rules of competition. In competitions where Kansa Assistant is not applicable or available, it is KANSA`s responsibility to ensure that the equipment is in accordance with the rules before each bout.

4.4 Formalities and change of judges
4.4.1 At the start of a Kumite match, the Referee stands on the outside edge of the match area. On the Referee’s left stand Judges numbers 1 and 2, and on the right stand Judges numbers 3 and 4.

4.4.2 After the formal exchange of bows by Athletes and the Referee panel, the Referee takes a step back, the Judges turn towards the Referee, and all bow together. All then take up their positions.

4.4.3 When changing the Judges, the departing Officials, except the Match Supervisor, line up, bow together (REI), and then leave the area.

4.4.4 When individual Judges change, the incoming Judge goes to the outgoing Judge, they bow together and change positions.

4.4.5 In Team matches, provided that the entire panel holds the required qualification, the positions of Referee and Judges must be rotated between each bout. If one or more officials do not hold the required qualification as Referee, they will remain as sitting Judges and be omitted from the rotation.

4.5 Procedure for refereeing Kumite with only two corner Judges

4.5.1 For Youth League competitions, the use of only two corner Judges is allowed. This procedure is described in APPENDIX 5.

ARTICLE 5: DURATION OF BOUT
5.1 Duration of the Kumite bout is:
- Senior Male and Female categories: 3 minutes effective time
- Under 21 Male and Female categories: 3 minutes effective time
- Cadet and Junior Male and Female categories: 2 minutes effective time
- Under 14 years: 1.5 minutes effective time 
 
5.2 For tournaments without limitation to participation, the duration of Elimination bouts may be reduced from 3 minutes to 2 minutes and from 2 minutes to 1.5 minutes, provided that this is announced prior to tournament start in a meeting for both Coaches and officials.

5.3 The timing of the bout starts when the Referee gives the signal to start and stops each time the Referee calls “YAME", when two or more judges give the electronic signal for a score, or at the signal for full time.

5.4 The timekeeper shall give a signal, indicating “15 seconds to go” by one short burst with the buzzer, and “time up” by two short bursts with the buzzer. The “time up” signal marks the end of the bout.

5.5 Athletes are entitled to a rest period between bouts, equal to the standard duration time of the bout. The exception is in the case of a change of equipment colour, where this time is extended to five minutes.

ARTICLE 6:  KIKEN – FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE TATAMI
6.1 KIKEN is the decision given when an Athlete or Athletes fail to present themselves when called, are unable to continue, abandon the bout, or are withdrawn on the order of the Tournament Doctor. The grounds for abandonment may include injury not ascribable to the opponent’s actions.

6.2 Individual Athletes or Teams that do not present themselves when called will be disqualified (KIKEN) from that category. In Team matches, the score for the bout not taking place will then be set to 8-0 (counted as YUKO) in favour of the other Team. In Individual Round-robin, the score for the bout will be set to 4-0 (counted as YUKO).

6.3 Points earned as a result of the opponent’s disqualification are always counted as YUKO.

6.4 Disqualification by KIKEN means that the Athletes are disqualified from that category, although it does not affect participation in another category.

6.5 When announcing disqualification by KIKEN, the Referee will signal by pointing their finger towards the side of the missing Athlete or Team, announcing “AKA/AO KIKEN”, and then “AKA/AO no KACHI”, giving the signal for KACHI (win) for the opponent.
 
ARTICLE 7: 
STARTING, SUSPENDING AND ENDING OF MATCHES 
 
7.1 The terms and gestures to be used by the Referee and Judges in the operation of a bout/match 
shall be as specified in APPENDIX 2. 
 
7.2 For each round, there will be a bowing ceremony starting with the Referee first having 
Athletes and officials face the audience and bow SHOMEN NI REI, followed by a bow to each 
other, OTAGAI NI REI. At the end of the bout(s), the bowing ceremony is done in the opposite 
sequence.   
 
7.3 The Referee and Judges shall take up their prescribed positions and, following an exchange of 
bows between the Athletes who are positioned at the front on their assigned mats nearest 
their opponent, the Referee will announce “SHOBU HAJIME!” and the bout will commence.  
 
7.4 The Athletes must bow properly to each other at the start and the end of the bout – a quick 
nod is both discourteous and insufficient.   
 
7.5 The Referee will stop the bout by announcing “YAME”. If necessary, the Referee will order the 
Athletes to take up their original positions: “MOTO NO ICHI” and return to their position. 
 
7.6 In the case of a score to be awarded, the Referee identifies the Athlete (AKA or AO), the area 
attacked (JODAN or CHUDAN), the technique (TSUKI, UCHI or KERI), and then awards the 
relevant score (YUKO, WAZA-ARI or IPPON) using the prescribed gesture. The Referee then 
restarts the bout by calling “TSUZUKETE HAJIME”. 
 
7.7 When an Athlete has been awarded a score that results in a lead of eight points or more, the 
bout is over.  The winner is declared by the Referee raising a hand on the side of the winner 
and declaring “AO (AKA) NO KACHI”.  
 
7.8 When time is up, the Athlete who has the most points is declared the winner, indicated by the 
Referee raising a hand on the side of the winner, and declaring “AO (AKA) NO KACHI”. The 
bout has ended at this point. 
 
7.9 In the event of a tied score at the end of an inconclusive bout, the Referee Panel (the Referee 
and the four Judges) will decide the bout by HANTEI. The four judges will immediately give the 
signal after the Referee calls for “HANTEI” and blows the whistle. The Referee will thereafter 
raise their arm and declare the winner, “AO (AKA) NO KACHI”, and if necessary, by this action, 
break the tie.  
 
7.10 When faced with the following situations, the Referee will call “YAME!” and halt the bout temporarily:
a) When either or both Athletes are out of the Competition area, with the exception of allowing an Athlete to immediately score on an opponent who has exited the competition area.
b) When the Referee orders the Athlete to adjust the KARATEGI or protective equipment. 
c) When an Athlete has contravened the rules. 
d) When the Referee considers that one or both of the Athletes cannot continue with 
the bout owing to injuries, illness or other causes, in accordance with the Tournament 
Doctor’s opinion, the Referee will decide whether the bout should be continued. 
e) When an Athlete seizes the opponent and does not perform an immediate technique 
or throw. 
f) When one or both Athletes fall or are thrown, and neither Athlete manages to 
immediately follow up with a scoring technique. 
g) When both Athletes seize or clinch with each other without immediately succeeding 
in executing a throw or a scoring technique, or do not immediately respond to 
WAKARETE. 
h) When both Athletes stand chest to chest without immediately attempting a throw or 
other technique and do not respond to WAKARETE.  
i) When both Athletes are off their feet following a fall or attempted throw and begin to wrestle.
j) When a score is indicated by two or more Judges for the same Athlete.
k) When, in the opinion of the Referee, there has been a foul committed – or the situation calls for halting the bout for safety reasons.
l) When requested to do so by KANSA or the Tatami Manager.
m) When a Coach, or both Coaches, request a video review.
n) For any other reason that the Referee deems necessary.

7.11 In the event that a bout starts without the time being recorded and the bout is then halted, 
and the remaining time is agreed upon between both coaches, the issue of the duration of the 
bout can no longer be protested.
 
ARTICLE 8: SCORING 
8.1 A score is awarded to an Athlete when two or more judges indicate a score or when the Video 
Review Judge agrees on a score after a Coach has raised a Video Request.  
 
8.2 Points are scored by a traditional karate technique with the hand or foot executed with control 
to the scoring area.  
 
8.3 Only the first correctly executed technique of an exchange will score, with the exception of an 
effective combination of techniques, in which case the highest scoring technique will count 
regardless of the sequence of techniques in the combination. 
 
8.4 The scoring areas are the body above the pelvis, up to and including the collarbone (CHUDAN), 
excluding the junction of the upper bone of the arm with the shoulder blades and collarbones, 
and the area above the collarbone (JODAN). 
 
8.5 In order to be considered a score, the technique must have the potential to be effective if it 
had not been controlled, and must also fulfil the criteria of: 
1) Good form (Properly executed technique). 
2) Sporting attitude (Delivered without intent to cause injury). 
3) Vigorous application (Delivery with speed and power). 
4) Maintaining awareness of the opponent both during and after execution of the technique 
(Not turning away or falling down after completing a technique – unless the fall is caused 
by a foul by the opponent). 
5) Good timing (Delivery of the technique at the correct moment). 
6) Correct distance (Delivery at a distance where the technique would be effective). 
 
In order to be a valid score, a technique has to fulfil all the six scoring criteria. 
 
8.6 The following scale is used for awarding of points: 
- YUKO (1 point) is awarded for TSUKI (straight punch) or UCHI (strike) to a scoring area. 
- WAZA ARI (2 points) is awarded for CHUDAN kicks. 
- IPPON (3 points) is awarded for JODAN kicks or any hand techniques against an opponent 
whose any part of the body other than the feet is in contact with the mat, with the 
exception of HIZA GAMAE (One knee touching the mat while executing a technique).   

8.7 Techniques to the CHUDAN area may be delivered with controlled impact without causing injury 
to the opponent. A loss of breath by the recipient of a blow does not in itself indicate lack of 
control. 
 
8.8 Techniques to the JODAN area can score when stopped within 5 cm of the target for kicks and 
2 cm for hand techniques, but may be delivered with light touch (skin touch), without causing 
impact, with the exception of the throat area, where no physical contact is allowed. For Cadet 
and U14 competitions, techniques to the JODAN area can score when stopped within 10 cm 
of the target for kicks and 5 cm for hand techniques, but may be delivered with light touch 
(skin touch), without causing impact. 
 
8.9 “Skin touch” is allowed in all age categories. “Skin touch” is defined as touching the target 
without transferring energy into the protected helmet or head of the Athlete. 
 
8.10 Correctly executed techniques landed at the moment the time runs out are valid. When using 
electronic judging, points must be signalled within 1.5 seconds of time expiring.  
 
8.11 A technique is invalid if: 
a) Executed after the time-up signal or the Referee calling “YAME”. 
b) Executed upon or after “WAKARETE” before “TSUZUKETE” has been called. 
c) Executed when the performer is outside the competition area (JOGAI). 
d) Followed by a foul of excessive contact or otherwise causing injury. 
e) One turns one’s back to the opponent after a technique (lack of awareness). 
f) It in itself is, or follows, a violation of the rules (such as excessive contact, holding, grabbing, etc.). 
 
ARTICLE 9: PROHIBITED BEHAVIOUR
9.1 Types of prohibited behaviour
9.1.1 The following behaviours are prohibited:
1) Techniques that make excessive contact, having regard to the scoring area attacked, and techniques that make contact with the throat.
2) Attacks to the arms, legs, groin, joints, or instep. 
3) Attacks to the face with open-hand techniques. 
4) Techniques executed after “WAKARETE” and before “TSUZUKETE” have been called. 
5) Dangerous or forbidden throwing techniques. 
6) Feigning or exaggerating injury. 
7) Exit from the competition area (JOGAI) not caused by the opponent or following a score. 
8) Self-endangerment by indulging in behaviour that exposes the Athlete to injury by the opponent, or failing to take adequate measures for self-protection (MUBOBI).
9) Avoiding combat as a means of preventing the opponent from having the opportunity to score.
10) Passivity – not attempting to engage in combat (Cannot be given in the first 15 seconds of the bout, after there are less than 15 seconds left of the bout, or to someone having a lead by points or SENSHU).
11) Clinching, wrestling, pushing, or standing chest to chest without attempting a scoring technique or takedown.
12) Grabbing the opponent with both hands for any reason other than executing a takedown upon catching the opponent’s kicking leg.
13) Grabbing the opponent’s arm or Karategi with one hand without immediately attempting a scoring technique or takedown.
14) Techniques, which by their nature, cannot be controlled for the safety of the opponent and dangerous and uncontrolled attacks.
15) Simulated or actual attacks with the head, knees, or elbows. 
16) Kicking techniques against a downed opponent who is lying flat on the floor. 
17) Talking to, or goading the opponent, failing to obey the orders of the Referee, discourteous behaviour towards the Refereeing officials, or other violations of etiquette.
 
9.1.2  An Athlete who delivers a scoring technique and then exits the area before the Referee calls 
“YAME” will be given the value of the score and JOGAI will not be imposed. If the Athlete’s 
attempt to score is unsuccessful, the exit will be recorded as a JOGAI.  
 
9.1.3 An Athlete staying within the TATAMI can score on an opponent that is exiting, or has exited, 
provided that the Athlete making the score remains within the TATAMI at the moment of 
scoring. In such instances, the Athlete scored upon will not receive JOGAI.

9.1.4 A Referee may, based solely on their own Judgement, ban from the competition floor any 
Coach failing to conform to proper conduct, or that, in the opinion of the Referee, interferes 
with the orderly conduct of the bout, and postpone the continuation of a bout until the Coach 
complies. The same authority of the Referee extends to the compliance of other members of 
the Athlete’s entourage present on the competition floor. Coaches banned from the 
competition are not allowed to coach or guide the Athletes, in or out of the field of play. 

9.1.5 
Only the Coach designated for that specific bout is allowed to coach and guide the Athlete 
from the place allocated to the Coach, close to the competition area. All other registered and 
accredited Coaches, or other registered member of the delegation, attending the 
Championships are not allowed to interfere, coach and/or guide the Athlete during the same 
bout at the risk of having their accreditation withdrawn. 
 
9.1.6 
Instructions and comments from the Coach must not interfere with the proceedings. The 
Coach may freely speak to the Athlete when the match is halted, but must at all times refrain 
from commenting on judgements. 
 
9.1.7 
The Athlete may discreetly signal to the Coach the wish for them to request a video review.  
 
ARTICLE 10: WARNINGS & PENALTIES 
10.1 Informal Warnings 
 
10.1.1  Informal warnings are used to facilitate the continuity of action without stopping the bout. 
They are not meant to replace formal warnings when these are appropriate, and the Referee 
should proceed with formal warnings or penalties as appropriate if the Athletes do not react 
upon the informal warning. 
 
10.1.2 There are two types of Informal Warnings: 
TSUZUKETE for encouraging activity: 
To urge the Athletes to commence activity by gesturing in the 
same way as is customary for making the Athletes stepping on to 
the TATAMI, combined with the instruction “TSUZUKETE”. 

WAKARETE for breaking up a clinch:
To break-up a clinch, using the same gesture as is customary for 
making the Athletes step back on the TATAMI combined with 
giving the order “WAKARETE” to temporarily stop the action 
without stopping the clock. The Athletes must separate – after 
which the order “TSUZUKETE” is given for resuming action.  

10.1.3 When WAKARETE is called when an Athlete is cornered, the Referee must ensure that the 
other Athlete withdraws sufficiently to disengage before TSUZUKETE is called. 
 
10.1.4 TSUZUKTETE, unless preceded by WAKARETE, is not used if there is less than 15 seconds left 
of the bout. 
 
10.1.5 An otherwise correctly executed technique will not be given a score if executed at the same 
time as WAKARETE has been called, but will not be penalised. An uncontrolled technique will 
be subject to warning or penalty in the normal manner. 

10.2 Official Warnings 
 
10.2.1 There are two degrees of official warnings - CHUI and HANSOKU CHUI: 
 
CHUI Warning: Is given, up to three times, for smaller infractions that do not 
diminish the other Athlete’s chances of winning.  
 
HANSOKU CHUI Warning of disqualification in the event of further infractions: Is given for more serious infractions that reduces the other 
Athlete’s chances of winning or to an Athlete for any further 
infraction if three CHUI has already been given.  
 
10.3 Penalties 
10.3.1 There are two kinds of penalties, which are two different levels of disqualification:
 
HANSOKU Disqualification from the bout. 
This is the penalty of disqualification following a very serious infraction or when HANSOKU CHUI has already been given.  
 
SHIKKAKU Disqualification from the tournament.
This is a disqualification from the entire tournament including any subsequent category the offender may have been registered for. SHIKKAKU may be invoked when an Athlete fails to obey the orders of the Referee, acts maliciously, or commits an act, which harms the prestige and honour of Karate.
 
10.3.2 In instances where both AKA and AO are disqualified in the same bout by HANSOKU or SHIKKAKU, the opponents scheduled for the next round will win by bye (and no result is announced).

10.3.3 Serious violation of conduct, discipline, or malicious behaviour on or outside the competition area by the Athlete or their entourage may cause further disciplinary action from the WKF Disciplinary Commission or Executive Committee.
 
10.3.4 When a situation appears to possibly warrant a disqualification, the Referee can call one or more judges for a brief consultation (SHUGO) before announcing any decision. SHUGO is obligatory before imposing disqualifications based on time-wasting situations or in order to impose SHIKKAKU.
 
10.4 Warning and penalty application
10.4.1 Excessive contact: Where contact is considered by the Referee to be too strong, but does not diminish the Athlete’s chances of winning, a warning (CHUI) may be given.
 
10.4.2  Contact causing injury: Any technique that results in injury can, unless caused by the recipient, 
cause a warning or penalty. The Athletes must perform all techniques with control and good 
form. If they cannot, then regardless of the technique misused, a warning or penalty must be imposed. 
 
10.4.3 Observation after contact: The Referee must continue to observe the injured Athlete until the 
bout is resumed and allow adequate time for observation. A short delay in giving a judgment 
allows injury symptoms such as a nosebleed to develop or reveal any efforts by the Athlete to 
aggravate a slight injury for tactical advantage. 
 
10.4.4 Overreaction to contact: A slight overreaction will receive a CHUI. An obvious display of 
exaggeration will receive a HANSOKU CHUI. A more serious exaggeration, such as staggering 
around, falling on the floor, standing up and falling down again, and so on, may receive 
HANSOKU directly. 
 
10.4.5 Feigning an injury: Any instance of feigning an injury, however slight, will receive a minimum 
warning of CHUI, while an obvious display of feigning will receive a HANSOKU CHUI. A more 
serious display of feigning, such as feigning around, falling on the floor, standing up and falling 
down again, and so on, will receive SHIKKAKU directly. Any feigning of an injury from a 
technique that in fact has been determined by the judges as a point will, as a minimum, result 
in HANSOKU CHUI. 
 
10.4.6 Contact to the throat: Any contact to the throat, unless received by the recipient’s own fault, must result in a warning or penalty.
 
10.4.7 Throwing techniques are divided into two types. The established “conventional” karate leg 
sweeping techniques such as De Ashi Barai, Ko Uchi Gari, etc., where the opponent is swept 
off-balance or thrown without being grabbed first - and those throws requiring that the 
opponent be grabbed by one hand or held as the throw is executed. Both are allowed. 
 
10.4.8 The pivotal point of the throw must not be above the thrower’s hip level, and the opponent 
must be held onto throughout, so that a safe landing can be made. Over the shoulder throws 
are expressly forbidden, as are so-called “sacrifice” throws. 
 
10.4.9 Catching a kick: The only instance where a throw may be performed while holding onto the 
opponent with both hands is when trapping the opponent’s kicking leg. Holding on with both 
hands is only permitted when grabbing an opponent’s kicking leg for the purpose of executing 
a takedown, and then holding on to the opponent’s leg while the other grabs the opponent’s 
Karategi or body to break the fall. 
 
10.4.10 Grabbing the legs: It is forbidden to grab the opponent below the waist and lift and throw 
him/her or to reach down to pull the legs from under him/her. If an Athlete is injured as a 
result of a throwing technique, the Referee will decide whether a warning or penalty is called 
for. 
 
10.4.11 One hand grabbing: The Athlete may seize the opponent’s arm or Karategi with one hand for 
the purpose of executing a throw or a direct scoring technique – but may not keep holding on 
for continuous techniques. 
  
10.4.12 Holding on to break a fall: Holding on to the opponent’s Karategi with one hand is permitted 
to break a fall. 
 
10.4.13 Exiting the competition area: JOGAI relates to a situation where an Athlete's foot, or any other 
part of the body, touches the floor outside of the competition area. An exception is when the 
Athlete is physically pushed or thrown from the area by the opponent or is exiting after having 
scored. 
 
10.4.14 Self endangerment: A warning or penalty for MUBOBI is given when an Athlete is hit or injured 
through their own fault or negligence. This may be caused by turning their back on the 
opponent, attacking without regard for the opponent’s counterattack, stopping fighting 
before the Referee calls “YAME”, dropping the guard or repeated failure or refusal to block 
the opponent’s attacks. 
 
If an Athlete has been asked before the bout starts, and confirms wearing a groin guard, and 
it later proves that this is not so, the Athlete will receive SHIKKAKU. If the Athlete has not been 
asked, but it is discovered that the Athlete does not wear a groin guard, the Athlete will be 
given two (2) minutes to correct the matter and will automatically receive a warning for 
MUBOBI. 
 
10.4.15 Passivity refers to situations where neither Athlete makes attempts to score, or a single 
Athlete does not attempt to score despite being behind on points or the opponent has a lead 
because of SENSHU. The Referee, before stopping the bout to give passivity, must first 
announce TSUZEKETE as an informal warning, using the appropriate signal and command. 
Passivity cannot be given during the first or last 15 seconds of a bout. 

10.4.16 Avoiding Combat refers to a situation where an Athlete attempts to prevent the opponent 
from having the opportunity to score by using time-wasting behaviour such as constantly 
retreating without an effective counter, holding, clinching, or exiting the competition area 
rather than allowing the opponent an opportunity to score. Avoiding combat during the last 
15 seconds of the bout (ATO SHIBARAKU) will, as a minimum, result in HANSOKU CHUI and 
loss of SENSHU. 
 
10.4.17  Not following instructions: An Athlete who refuses to follow the instructions of the Referee 
or displays a loss of temper will automatically receive SHIKKAKU.  This penalty may be imposed 
before, during or after the bout. 
 
10.5. Excessive celebration, political or religious demonstration: Athletes are expected to respect 
the ceremony of salutations before and after the bout or match. Any excessive celebration, 
such as falling on one’s knees, etc., political or religious expressions, during or immediately 
after the bout or match, are prohibited and may be subject to a fine equal to the amount 
determined by the Executive Committee for the protest fee. 
 
10.6 Disqualification of individual Athletes in Team matches 
 
 
10.6.1 HANSOKU or SHIKKAKU: In Team matches, the offended Athlete’s score will be set at 8 points, and the offender’s score will be zeroed.
 
10.7 Disqualification in Round-robin competition.
 
10.7.1 If an Athlete receives HANSOKU, KIKEN or SHIKKAKU in a Round-robin bout, the offender’s 
score for the bout is set to zero while the opponent’s score is set to the higher of 4 points or 
points earned by techniques. Points scored by techniques retain their original value as 
respectively IPPON, WAZA-ARI or YUKO.  Points added other than scored are all measured as 
YUKO.

10.7.2 If an Athlete receives KIKEN or SHIKKAKU in Round-robin competition, all previous bouts are 
voided from the result unless it is the last scheduled bout for the disqualified Athlete, in which 
case the result of the bout is recorded in the usual manner without consequence for the 
results of the previous bouts.  
 
ARTICLE 11: INJURIES AND ACCIDENTS IN COMPETITION 
11.1 Athletes declared unfit to fight 
11.1.1 An injured Athlete who wins a bout through disqualification due to injury is not allowed to 
fight again in the competition without permission from the tournament doctor. No such 
permission can be given to an Athlete who has suffered a loss of consciousness or otherwise 
has any symptoms of concussion.  
 
11.1.2 An injured Athlete, permitted to continue, may also win a second bout by disqualification due 
to injury, but is immediately withdrawn from further Kumite competition in that tournament. 
 
11.2 Procedure for handling injuries  
 
11.2.1 When an Athlete is injured, the Referee shall at once halt the bout and call the doctor by raising his hand and verbally call out “doctor”.
 
11.2.2 If physically able to do so, the injured Athlete should be directed off the mat for examination 
and treatment by the doctor.

11.2.3 An Athlete who is injured during a bout in progress and requires medical treatment will be 
allowed three minutes in which to receive it. The Tatami Manager is responsible for instructing 
the timekeeper to start the 3-minute count. If treatment is not completed within the time 
allowed, the Referee will decide if the Athlete shall be declared unfit to fight, or whether an 
extension of treatment time shall be given. 
 
11.2.4 10-second rule: Any Athlete who lies flat on the floor after a fall, being thrown, or knocked 
down, and does not fully regain their feet within ten seconds, is considered unfit to continue 
fighting and will be automatically withdrawn from all Kumite events in that tournament. In 
the event that an Athlete lies flat on the floor after a fall, being thrown, or knocked down and 
does not regain their feet immediately, the Referee will stop the match, call the doctor, and 
at the same time start a verbal count to ten in the English language, indicating his count by 
showing a finger for each second. In all cases where the 10 second count has been started the 
doctor will be asked to examine the Athlete before the bout can resume. For incidents falling 
under this 10-second rule, the Athlete may be examined on the mat. The Tatami Manager 
must notify the central table when an Athlete has been stopped from further competition 
based on the 10-second rule. 
 
11.2.5 The tournament doctor is authorised to give an opinion on the injured Athlete’s fitness for 
continuation only. The Referee will decide the winner on the basis of HANSOKU, KIKEN, or 
SHIKKAKU as the case may be. 
 
11.2.6 The Referee must be aware of pre-existing injuries when evaluating to what degree the 
present state of injury could be attributed to actions by the opponent. The opponent should 
not be penalized for any pre-existing condition.   
 
11.2.7 Should an Athlete in Round-robin competition have to withdraw because of injury, all 
previous bouts are voided from the result unless it is the last scheduled bout for the injured 
Athlete, in which case the result of the bout is recorded in the usual manner without 
consequence for the results of the previous bouts. 

11.3 Injury to both Athletes 
If two Athletes injure each other or are suffering from the effects of previously incurred injury 
and are declared by the Tournament Doctor to be unable to continue, the bout is decided as 
one normally would at full time. 

ARTICLE 12: CRITERIA FOR DECISION 
12.1 General 
12.1.1 When two or more Judges signal a score for the same Athlete, the Referee will stop the bout 
and render the decision accordingly. Should the Referee fail to stop the bout, the Match 
Supervisor will blow their whistle. When the Referee decides to halt the bout for any reason, 
they will call “YAME” at the same time using the required hand signal. 

12.1.2 In the event that both Athletes have a score signalled by two Judges, both Athletes will be awarded their respective points.

12.1.3 If one Athlete has a score indicated by more than one Judge, and the score is different 
between the Judges, the higher score will be applied. The same applies if there are two judges 
for each Athlete with different scores. 
 
12.1.4 If there is a majority, but disagreement, among the Judges for one level of score, the majority 
opinion will always overrule the principle of applying the highest score. 
 
12.1.5 When explaining the basis for a decision after the bout or match, the Referee Panel may speak 
to the Tatami Manager, the Chief Referee, or the Appeals Jury. They will explain themselves 
to no one else. 
 
12.2 Criteria for deciding the winner of a bout
 
12.2.1 The result of a bout is determined by an Athlete obtaining a clear lead of 8 points, at time-up 
having the highest number of points; at equal score, having the first unopposed point 
advantage (SENSHU); obtaining a decision by HANTEI or by a HANSOKU, SHIKKAKU, or KIKEN 
imposed against an opponent. 
 
12.2.2 By first unopposed score advantage (SENSHU), it is understood that one Athlete has achieved 
the first instance of scoring on the opponent without having the opponent also score before 
the signal. In instances where both Athletes score before the signal, and there is an indication 
of score by two judges for each of the two Athletes, no ‘first unopposed score advantage’ is 
awarded, and both Athletes retain the possibility of SENSHU later in the bout. 
 
12.2.3 In any individual bout (Individual, Round-robin, and Teams) where no superior score has been 
obtained by either Athlete, or the score is equal without any Athlete having a ‘first unopposed 
score advantage’ (SENSHU), the decision will be made based on the following criteria in order 
of application: 
a) The higher number of IPPON scored in the bout. 
b) The higher number of WAZA ARI scored in the bout. 
 
12.2.4 Should the number of IPPON and WAZA ARI be equal, the decision will be made by HANTEI, a 
final majority vote of the four Judges and the Referee, each casting their vote based on their 
individual judgement of which Athlete displayed superiority of tactics and techniques. In 
Round-robin and Team bouts, HIKIWAKE will be given unless it is an extra bout to decide a 
match outcome. 
 
12.2.5 Individual elimination bouts cannot be declared a tie, with the exceptions of Team 
competition, or Round-robin competition, when a bout ends with no scores, equal scores, no 
superiority in IPPON or WAZA ARI, and neither Athlete has obtained SENSHU, the Referee will 
announce a tie (HIKIWAKE). 
 
12.2.6 The only time HANTEI is applied to a bout in Team competition is for an additional bout to 
break a tie. 
 
 
12.2.7 When deciding the outcome of a bout by vote (HANTEI) at the end of an inconclusive bout, 
the Referee will move to the competition area perimeter and call “HANTEI”, followed by a 
blast of the whistle. The Judges will signal their opinions, and the Referee will declare the 
winner. The Referee will then indicate the winner by hand signal and the order (AKA/AO NO 
K ACHI), and by this action also resolve any tie.  
 
12.2.8 Should an Athlete who has been awarded SENSHU receive a warning for avoiding combat for 
the following incidents: JOGAI, running away, clinching, grabbing, wrestling, pushing or 
standing chest to chest when there is less than 15 seconds left of the bout – the Athlete will 
automatically forfeit this advantage. The Referee will then first show the type of infraction 
and type of warning or penalty the Athlete did, then show the sign for SENSHU, followed by 
the sign for annulment (TORIMASEN) and at the same time announcing “AKA/AO SENSHU 
TORIMASEN”. 
 
12.2.9 In cases where SENSHU has been awarded, but a successful video request determines that 
the other opponent also scored, and that a score in fact is not unopposed, the same 
procedure is used for nullification of SENSHU.  
 
 
12.2.10 If SENSHU is withdrawn when it is less than 15 seconds left of the bout, no further SENSHU 
can be awarded to either Athlete.  
 
 
12.2.11 In instances of Elimination competition, where both AKA and AO are disqualified in the same 
bout by HANSOKU, KIKEN or SHIKKAKU, the opponents scheduled for the next round will win 
by bye (and no result is announced), unless the double disqualification applies to a medal 
bout, in which case the winner will be declared based on the scores at the moment of 
disqualification, SENSHU, or if none of these conditions are present; by direct HANTEI.  
No medal can be awarded to an Athlete disqualified by SHIKKAKU. 
 
12.3 Determining the winner of a round-robin group and resolving ties in individual competition 
 
12.3.1 
The winner of a group in Individual round robin-competition, is the Athlete having the most 
victory points gained by 3 points for won bouts and 1 victory Point for draws, where points 
are scored. In cases where there is a tie between two or more Athletes in a group, having the 
same number of victory Points, the criteria below will be applied in the specified order. This 
means that if a winner is found after one of the criteria, the following criteria will not have 
to be applied. 
 
1) Winner of the bout between the Athletes involved in the tie. 
2) Higher number of total scores obtained in favour through all bouts. 
3) Lower number of total scores against through all bouts. 
4) Higher number of IPPON obtained in favour through all bouts. 
5) Lower number of IPPON against through all bouts. 
6) Higher number of WAZA ARI obtained in favour through all bouts. 
7) Lower number of WAZA ARI against through all bouts. 
8) The highest World Ranking at the date of the competition. 
9) Extra bout allowing HANTEI. 
For each pair compared, the criteria must be considered from the beginning of the list.  
 
 
12.3.2 It is possible for an Athlete to be disqualified from a bout (HANSOKU) and continue the 
competition. In this case, their opponent wins that bout by either 4-0 (counted as YUKO) or 
for any score obtained exceeding 4 points.  
 
12.3.3 If an already qualified Athlete is disqualified for misconduct (SHIKKAKU) at the end of the

12.4 Determining the winner of a Round-robin group and resolving ties, in Team competition 
 
12.4.1 The winner of a group in Team Round-robin competition is the Team having the most victory 
Points gained by 3 points for won matches and 1 point for draws where points are scored. In 
cases where there is a tie between two or more Teams in a group, having the same number 
of victory Points, the criteria below will be applied in the specified order. This means that if a 
winner is found after one of the criteria, the following criteria will not have to be applied. 
 
1) Winner of the match between teams involved in tie. 
2) Highest number of bouts won during the entire Round-robin phase. 
3) Largest number of points scored during the entire Round-robin phase. 
4) Least number of points scored against the Team during entire the Round-robin phase. 
5) Largest number of IPPON scored by the Team during the entire Round-robin phase. 
6) Least number of IPPON scored against the Team during the entire Round-robin phase. 
7) Largest number of WAZA ARI scored by the Team during the entire Round-robin phase. 
8) Least number of WAZA ARI scored against the Team during the entire Round-robin phase. 
9) An additional bout between one of the members of each Team – if necessary, decided by HANTEI.
For each pair compared, the criteria must be considered from the beginning of the list. 
 
12.5 Criteria for deciding the winner of a Team match using Elimination 
 
12.5.1 The winning Team is the one with the most bout victories, including those won by SENSHU. 
Should the two Teams have the same number of bout victories, then the winning Team will 
be the one with the most points.  
 
12.5.2 If the two Teams have the same number of bout victories and points, then a deciding bout will 
be held. Each Team may nominate any one Athlete of their Team for the purpose of fighting 
the extra bout, regardless of whether that Athlete has already fought in a previous bout 
between the two Teams.  
 
12.5.3 If the extra bout does not produce a winner based on superiority on points, nor any of the 
Athletes receive SENSHU, the extra bout will be decided based on HANTEI according to the 
same procedure as for individual bouts. The result of the HANTEI for the extra bout will then 
also determine the result of the Team match.  

12.5.4 In Team matches, when a Team has won sufficient bout victories or scored sufficient points 
to be the established winner, then the match is declared over, and no further bouts will take 
place, except in Round-robin, where all bouts must be fought. 
 
12.5.5 In Team matches, should a Team member be disqualified (HANSOKU or SHIKKAKU), their score 
for that bout, if any, will be zeroed, and the opponent’s score will be set at eight points. 
 
12.6 Scorekeeping 
The Score Supervisor will use the following symbols for registration of points: 
3 - IPPON - Three-point score
2 - WAZA ARI - Two-point score
1 - YUKO - One-point score

representative are the only ones allowed to make a protest. 
 
13.1.3 The protest will take the form of a written report submitted immediately after the bout in 
which the protest was generated. The sole exception is when the protest concerns an 
administrative malfunction.  
 
13.1.4 Any protest concerning application of the rules must not necessarily impede the progression 
of the competition, and the intent to protest must be announced by the Coach or NF 
representative immediately after the end of the bout.

the Athletes must be postponed until the appeal is decided. 
 
13.1.6 The Coach / NF representative will request the official protest form from the Tatami Manager. 
The written protest must be completed, and the protest fee submitted, within 5 minutes after 
receiving the protest form from the Tatami Manager. 
 
13.1.7 Failure of a Coach / NF representative to deliver a protest in a timely manner can lead to its 
rejection if such delay, in the opinion of the Appeals Jury, is without reasonable justification 
and impedes the progression of the competition.  
 
13.1.8 The Tatami Manager will complete any information regarding implicated officials and 
immediately hand the completed protest form to a representative of the Appeals Jury. The 
Appeals Jury will, without delay, review the circumstances leading to the protested decision. 
Having considered all the facts available, they will produce a report and shall be empowered 
to take such action as may be called for. The protest will be reviewed by the Appeals Jury, and 
as part of this review, the Jury will study the evidence available in support of the protest.  
 
13.1.9 The protest may also be directly decided and announced to the Appeals Jury by the RC 
Chairman or the Chief Referee of the event, in which case no payment of a protest fee will be 
applicable. 
 
13.1.10 In case of an administrative malfunction during a bout in progress, the Coach can notify the 
Tatami Manager directly. In turn, the Tatami Manager will notify the Match Supervisor 
(KANSA). 
 
13.1.11 The protest must give the name and country of the Athletes and the precise details of what is 
being protested. The information of officials implicated is completed by the Tatami Manager. 
No general claims about overall standards will be accepted as a legitimate protest. The burden 
of proving the validity of the protest lies with the complainant. The protest must be submitted 
to a representative of the Appeals Jury by the Tatami Manager. In due course, the Jury will 
review the circumstances leading to the protested decision. 
 
13.1.12 The protester must deposit a Protest Fee as agreed by the WKF EC, and this, together with the 
protest, must be given to the Tatami Manager, who will turn it over to a representative of the 
Appeals Jury.  
 
13.1.13 The intent to protest must be declared as soon as the bout is finished. The written protest 
must be completed, and the protest fee submitted, within 5 minutes after receiving the 
protest form from the Tatami Manager. 
 
13.1.14 The decision of the Appeals Jury is final and may only be overruled by a decision of the 
Executive Committee upon request of the WKF President.  
 
13.1.15 The Appeals Jury may not impose sanctions or penalties. Their function is to pass judgment 
on the merit of the protest to start required actions from the RC and OC to take remedial 
action to rectify any Refereeing procedure found to contravene the rules. 
 
13.2 Composition of the Appeals Jury 
13.2.1 The Appeals Jury is comprised of three Senior Referee representatives appointed by the 
Referee Commission (RC) or the Chief Referee. No two members may be appointed from the 
same National Federation. They will be numbered from 1 to 3. 
 
13.2.2 The RC will also appoint three additional members with designated numbering from 4 to 6 
that automatically will replace any of the originally appointed Appeals Jury members in a 
conflict-of-interest situation. i.e., where the jury member is of the same nationality, has a 
family relationship by blood or as an In-Law with any of the parties involved or any other 
reasonable conflict or potential conflict of interest in the protested incident, including all 
members of the Refereeing panel involved in the protested incident. 
 
13.3 Appeals Evaluation Process 
13.3.1 It is the responsibility of the Tatami Manager to receive the protest, to gather the Appeals 
Jury, and deposit the protest sum with WKF for any declined protest. 
 
13.3.2 The Appeals Jury will immediately make such inquiries and investigations as they consider 
necessary to validate the merit of the protest.  
 
13.3.3 Where video review is used, the Appeals Jury may request to examine the video recording of 
the incident before rendering a verdict.  
 
13.3.4 Each of the three members is obliged to give their verdict as to the validity of the protest. 
Abstentions are not acceptable. 
 
13.4 Declined and accepted protests 
13.4.1 If a protest is found invalid, the Appeals Jury will appoint one of its members to verbally notify 
the protester that the protest has been declined, mark the original document with the word 
“DECLINED”, have it signed by each of the members of the Appeals Jury, and inform the 
protester of the decision. 
 
13.4.2 If a protest is accepted, the appeals Jury will liaise with the Organising Commission (OC) and 
the Chief Referee to take such measures as can be practically carried out to remedy the 
situation, including the possibilities of: 
- Reversing previous judgments that contravene the rules. 
- Voiding results of the affected rounds from the point before the incident. 
- Redoing such bouts that have been affected by the incident. 
- Issuing a recommendation to the RC for any involved Judges evaluated for sanction. 
 
13.4.3 The responsibility rests with the Appeals Jury to exercise restraint and sound judgment in 
taking actions that will disturb the program of the event in any significant manner. Reversing 
the process of the Eliminations is a last option to secure a fair outcome. 
 
13.4.4 If the protest is accepted, the Appeals Jury will appoint one of its members who will verbally 
notify the protester that the protest has been accepted, mark the original document with the 
word “ACCEPTED”, and have it signed by each of the members of the Appeals Jury, before 
depositing the protest with the Chief Referee, and returning the protest fee to the protester. 
 
13.4.5  An accepted protest does not mean that a bout or match will automatically be redone. 
 
13.5 Incident report 
13.5.1 After handling the incident in the above prescribed manner, the Appeals Jury will meet again 
and elaborate a simple protest incident report, describing their findings and stating their 
reason(s) for accepting or rejecting the protest. 
 
13.5.2 The report should be signed by all three members of the Appeals Jury and submitted to the 
Chief Referee and the Organising Commission.  
 
ARTICLE 14:  VIDEO REVIEW REQUEST 
14.1 In WKF World Championships, Premier League, Olympic Games, Youth Olympic Games, 
Continental Games, World Games, and multisport games of this nature, the use of video 
review of bouts is required. Use of video review is also recommended for other competitions 
whenever possible. 
 
14.2 The video review is initiated when a Coach raises their video review card (manually or by 
electronic device as applicable) to signal that a possible score of their Athlete that was missed 
by the judges. If a Coach pushes the joy stick’s button and then immediately regrets it, the 
procedure will not be stopped, and the video review will take place accordingly. The Coach 
should stand up during the video review to make the Referee aware and avoid continuation 
of the bout if the system malfunctions. 
 
14.3 In competitions where Coaches are provided electronic equipment that allows requesting 
review for specifically YUKO, WAZA ARI or IPPON, the Video Review Judge is only required to 
evaluate a possible score for the type of point requested.   The Coach may change the level of 
the score up until the Referee finishes the signal for video review. 
 
14.4 If the Athlete wishes to have the Coach request a video review or refrain from raising a review, 
this must be discreetly signalled without disturbing the progress of the bout.  
 
14.5 The video review can be requested by the Coach in instances where the Judges awarded a 
lower score than, in the opinion of the Coach, should be for a higher scoring technique. 
 
14.6 The Video Review Judge may only award points if the Athlete for whom the request was raised 
had a valid score, i.e. scoring before or simultaneously with the other Athlete.  
 
14.7 An exception from above sub article is when neither Athlete has been awarded a point by the 
corner Judges, only one of the Coaches calls a Video review, the other Coach has no card or 
do not wish a video request – in which case only the techniques of the Athlete whom video 
review is called for will be considered for scoring.   
 
14.8 The last 6 seconds before the bout was stopped for the request will always be evaluated, but 
additional time can be added as deemed necessary to make the best possible decision. The 
sequence must be reviewed at normal speed but can in addition be viewed in slow motion or 
zoom if necessary. The review must always first be done at full speed, although slow motion 
may subsequently be used to determine details. The total time used for reviewing the video 
is not to exceed 30 seconds, after which a decision must be rendered.   
 
14.09 If both Coaches request video review at the same time, the Video Review Judge may only 
award the point to whoever is deemed to score first. The only exception being simultaneous 
scoring techniques, in which case points can be awarded to both Athletes. 
  
14.10 If one Coach shows the card for video review and the other Coach wants a review of the 
same instance, the second Coach must raise his card before the review starts in order not to 
lose his right to request video review for that instance. The video review is considered 
started when the Referee makes the gesture. 
 
14.11 If the request is found valid, a red or blue card, with the number 3 for IPPON, 2 for WAZA ARI 
or 1 for YUKO is raised or the outcome displayed on the monitor. The Referee will then award 
the score in the usual manner. If the request is found invalid, the Coach will lose the right to 
raise another video request for the remainder of the bout. 
 
 
14.12 The Video Review Judge may not overrule any decision by the corner judges with the
 exception of SENSHU.  
 
14.13 If the Video Review Judge is unable to observe the technique(s) due to camera angle, they 
will signal this by doing the gesture for MIENAI, and the Coach will retain the card. In the 
case of technical problems (electricity, camera, or computer malfunctions etc.) it is not 
possible to analyse the video and make a decision, the same procedure will apply, and the 
Coach will retain the card.  
 
14.15 If a Coach requests VR, but in the opinion of the Referee the technique was uncontrolled or 
too hard, a warning or penalty must be applied, and the Coach will retain the card. 
 
14.16 Once WAKARETE is called by the Referee, the Coaches do not have the opportunity to make a 
video request, unless the technique happened before WAKARETE was called. 
 
14.17 It remains the duty of the Coach to protest if a VR card is not returned whenever the Coach 
has the right to have the card returned by the Tatami Manager. 
 
14.18 The following table determines the video review cards allowable per phase for WKF events:

APPENDIX 5: TWO JUDGE SYSTEM  
Procedure for refereeing Kumite with only two corner Judges 
1. When using the two-corner judge system, the corner Judges and the Referee all have mutual 
responsibility for points. Flags are used by the Corner Judges for signalling. 
 
2. In addition to showing points, the Corner Judges will assist the Referee by giving signals for 
JOGAI and excessive contact, but the Referee remains autonomous in applying warnings and 
penalties, and will only be overruled by two judges indicating the same foul. 
 
3. Points are awarded if two Judges, or one Judge plus the Referee, agree on the score. 
 
4. In order to be able to cover all three angles of view, the referee should never position 
themselves on the same side as the two Judges. 
 
5. The Coaches should be placed in front of the Referee and not behind. 
 
6. The Referee can show and ask for support for points that are made in their field of play. In this 
case, the Referee´s signals for YUKO, WAZA ARI and IPPON are the same as in the regular 
Kumite rules, with the exception that the Referee's elbow is touching their torso while 
indicating the respective signal. After the Referee has received support, the signals when giving 
points are the same as for bouts under regular rules. 
 
7. If one Judge signals for a point and the other for a warning or penalty, the Referee will take 
the final decision by supporting one of the Judges. 
 
8. If the two Judges, or one Judge and the Referee, show different points for the same Athletes, 
the higher will be given. 
 
9. If one judge indicates a score but the Referee disagrees, the Referee will show the gesture for 
TORIMASEN without stopping the bout. 
 
10. If both Judges signal a point, but for different Athletes, the Referee may award both points.
